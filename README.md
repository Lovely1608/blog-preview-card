how to use the @media queries

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  @media and screen (max-width){....}
}
```
### Continued development

I am still not good yet at @media queries and flex-box for making my conetent in center without doing measure changes in the layout and keep it SEO friendly.
and also avoid using px(fixed unit for font and box size) responsive unit.
